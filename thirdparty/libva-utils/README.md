#Libva-utils Project

libva-utils is a collection of utilities and examples to exercise VA-API in
accordance with the libva project. --enable-tests (default = no) provides
a suite of unit-tests based on Google Test Framework. A driver implementation
is necessary to properly operate.

VA-API is an open-source library and API specification, which
provides access to graphics hardware acceleration capabilities
for video processing. It consists of a main library and
driver-specific acceleration backends for each supported hardware 
vendor.

We also recommend taking a look at the ['janitorial'
bugs](https://github.com/intel/libva-utils/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AJanitorial)
in our list of open issues as these bugs can be solved without an
extensive knowledge of libva-utils.
